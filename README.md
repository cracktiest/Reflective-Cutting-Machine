Initial probationary project involved the development of an automated machine equipped with a PID control system for precise cutting of reflective and elastic bands, allowing for adjustable sizing and quantity. Accelerated process by up to 450% compared to the previous machine (Pattering Stitching Machine). Additionally, the error rate was reduced to less than 1%, specifically 0,9900990099009901%.
